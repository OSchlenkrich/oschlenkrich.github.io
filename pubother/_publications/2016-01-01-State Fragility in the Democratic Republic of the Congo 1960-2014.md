excerpt: 'We introduce a two-dimensional actor-based concept of the quality of statehood which distinguishes between challenges and capacities in each dimension and highlights the strategic decisions made by state actors vis-à-vis the capacities and challenges. Analysing the interplay of these factors, we compare the quality of statehood between the presidencies of Kasa-Vubu (1960-1965), Mobutu (1965-1997) and the Kabilas (1997-2014).'

We introduce a two-dimensional actor-based concept of the quality of statehood which distinguishes between challenges and capacities in each dimension and highlights the strategic decisions made by state actors vis-à-vis the capacities and challenges. Analysing the interplay of these factors, we compare the quality of statehood between the presidencies of Kasa-Vubu (1960-1965), Mobutu (1965-1997) and the Kabilas (1997-2014).
