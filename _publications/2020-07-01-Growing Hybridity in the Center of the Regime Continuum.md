excerpt: 'The Democracy Matrix (DeMaX) is a tool for measuring the quality of democracy of over 175 countries in the period between 1900 and 2019 on the basis of Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem). It differs from other measurement instruments in its conceptualization, since it links the abstract norms freedom , equality and control with more concrete institutions. The updated DeMaX Version 3 continues the series with new data for the year 2019. This brief report presents some findings on recent developments in democratization around the world and contrasts them with long-term trends. The second part provides brief information about the methodology of the measurement instrument. Key Findings: - Almost half of the states of the world have democratic regimes, but only a little more than one fourth of the population of the world live in democracies. - The cases of de-democratization clearly outnumber the cases that had improved their quality of democracy at the turn of 2019. The current dynamic results in a growing hybridity - a trend of convergence towards the center of the regime continuum.'

The Democracy Matrix (DeMaX) is a tool for measuring the quality of democracy of over 175 countries in the period between 1900 and 2019 on the basis of Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem). It differs from other measurement instruments in its conceptualization, since it links the abstract norms freedom , equality and control with more concrete institutions. The updated DeMaX Version 3 continues the series with new data for the year 2019. This brief report presents some findings on recent developments in democratization around the world and contrasts them with long-term trends. The second part provides brief information about the methodology of the measurement instrument. Key Findings: - Almost half of the world's states have democratic regimes , but only a little more than one fourth of the world's population live in democracies. - The cases of de-democratization clearly outnumber the cases that had improved their quality of democracy at the turn of 2019. - The current dynamic results in a growing hybridity - a trend of convergence towards the center of the regime continuum.
