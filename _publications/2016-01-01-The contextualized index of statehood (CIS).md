excerpt: 'Although the measurement of the quality of statehood has become an important research field in Comparative Politics, most of the currently used indices are flawed by major weaknesses. To address such weaknesses, we developed the “Contextualized Index of Statehood” (CIS). This index is based on the two most essential dimensions of statehood: “monopoly on the use of physical force” and “administration”. Applying a new aggregation method called “variable threshold”, we highlight the interaction between the organizational capacities of a state and the contextual challenges it may face in order to measure the quality of statehood. First, we demonstrate the concept, measurement and aggregation. Then we investigate the validity of our index before presenting our empirical findings, including a model-based cluster analysis.'
